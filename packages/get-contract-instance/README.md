# @drizzle-utils/get-contract-instance

A tool for getting the contract instance from Web3. This requires the contract artifact JSON generated by Truffle (i.e. `truffle compile` and `truffle migrate`).

If an address is not supplied, or the deployed address is not found in the JSON artifact file, a contract instance will still be created but it will not have a deployed address associated with it. A warning will let you know of this, to suppress the warning, pass in `suppressWarnings: true` into the options object.

## Usage

```js
import getContractInstance from "@drizzle-utils/get-contract-instance";
import SimpleStorage from "./SimpleStorage.json";

// pass in web3 and contract artifact
const instance = await getContractInstance({
  web3,
  artifact: SimpleStorage,
});

// alternatively, pass in your own ABI and deployed address
const instance = await getContractInstance({
  web3,
  abi: SimpleStorage.abi,
  address: "0x..."
});
```
